# MapSimTNG

This code creates mock images of extragalactic fields from hydrodynamical cosmological simulations (GADGET-like or IllustrisTNG), emulating the properties of known observational surveys or instruments in terms of resolution and depth.

Lightcones supplied by Carlo Giocoli.
Photometry supplied by Bruzual & Charlot (Bruzual & Charlot, 2003).

The code is work-in-progress, photometry still not included.
